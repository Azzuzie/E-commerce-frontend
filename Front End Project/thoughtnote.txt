Hi i am Ajith ,
Here is my thoughtnote and also note that this frontend Ecommerce project is Responsive...

=>> Firstly, for the header, the logo should be placed on the left, followed by the search box and cart,login buttons 
on the right. The navigation bar should be placed right below the header with the links to products,
categories(men,women,kids) and contact .

=>> Secondly, for the footer, it should be consistent across all pages with a list of categories(men,women,kids)
 and links and a copyright message at the end.

=>> Thirdly, for the home page, the cover image should be placed at the center with the company slogan, followed by 
a slider showcasing the featured products. The footer should be at the bottom of the page. Each slider 
contains four cards.

=>> Fourthly, for the product pages, they should be categorized based on gender and sub-categories with a grid 
format for all products. 

=>> Fifthly, for the contact page, it should be designed in a simple and user-friendly manner with a form that 
asks for the username, email, and message and an image at left representimg company .

=>> Sixthly, for the login page, it should be designed with a clean and straightforward layout that asks for 
the user's email and password.

=>> Lastly, for the cart page, it should be designed with a clear layout that displays all the products added 
to the cart with an option to increase or decrease the quantity and a delete button.Along this at right 
i placed a card  which shows the summary(products price,shipping price,total price) of the products which
 are added to the cart.

=>> Overall, the design should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless
 shopping experience for the users.
